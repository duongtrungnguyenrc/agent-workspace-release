# Vibe Kanban Product Documentation Templates

Use these templates as Vibe Kanban ticket content. They are not local file templates.

## `group` Ticket Specification

A `group` is the user-story level: a coherent product capability that owns one or more `feature` tickets.

```markdown
# User Story

As a <actor>, I want <capability>, so that <outcome>.

## Context

- <product context>
- <user or business problem>

## Goals

- <goal>

## Features

- <Verb Noun>: <one-line goal>
- <Verb Noun>: <one-line goal>
- <Verb Noun>: <one-line goal>

## Acceptance Criteria

- AC-001: Given <context>, when <action>, then <expected result>.

## Constraints

- <product, business, UX, data, or technical constraint>

## Out of Scope

- <explicit non-goal>

## Open Questions

- <question or decision needed>

## Assumptions

- <assumption made because source material was incomplete>
```

## `feature` Ticket Specification

A `feature` is one use case: a distinct actor-system goal under its `group`, written as `Verb Noun`.

```markdown
# <Verb Noun>

## Context

- User Story: <story summary>
- Actor: <primary actor>
- Goal: <what the actor wants to achieve>

## Preconditions

- <required user/session/data/system condition>

## Trigger

- <event that starts the use case>

## Main Flow

1. <Actor> <does a meaningful action>.
2. System <responds with visible or meaningful behavior>.
3. <Actor> <continues the task>.
4. System <validates, records, calculates, routes, or displays the outcome>.

## Alternative Flows

- A1. <valid alternate path>
  1. <step>
  2. <system response>

## Exception Flows

- E1. <failure condition>
  1. System <detects or receives the failure>.
  2. System <prevents inconsistent state, rolls back, retries, or reports the error>.
  3. System <shows a useful message or recovery action>.

## Postconditions

- <system state after success>
- <important persisted data or status>

## Business Rules

- BR-001: <business rule>

## Acceptance Criteria

- AC-001: Given <context>, when <action>, then <expected result>.

## Open Questions

- <question or decision needed>

## Assumptions

- <assumption made because source material was incomplete>
```

## `task` Ticket Specification

Use task templates only when implementation has been requested and the current codebase has been explored, or when the user gives source tickets that should become agent work tickets with implementation plans. Do not create task tickets during story-building from idea documents.

```markdown
# Implementation Task

## Product Context

- Group: <story summary>
- Feature: <Verb Noun>
- Scenario: <concrete path or implementation slice>

## Objective

- <implementation objective>

## Acceptance Criteria

- <behavior or verification target>

## Constraints

- <scope, compatibility, data, UX, or integration constraint>

## Out of Scope

- <explicit non-goal>
```

## `task` Execution Plan

Create this only after enough source exploration to produce a grounded plan. Group by the child projects that actually exist inside the workflow's implementation scope, such as `source/backend`, `source/frontend`, or `source/mobile`. If source exploration is not sufficient, leave the task `execution_plan` empty or mark it as requiring exploration instead of inventing file paths or implementation steps.

```markdown
# Execution Plan

## source/<child-project>

- [ ] Inspect and confirm `<scope or flow>`.
- [ ] Implement `<behavior>` in `<path or module>`.
- [ ] Add or update `<tests>`.
- [ ] Run `<focused verification>` and record the result.

Each top-level checklist item is a monitorable execution step; `approve` requires at least one. Put supporting detail under the step as indented plain bullets, not as nested checkboxes.

Files:

- <path>

Changes:

- <change>

Tests:

- <test or verification>

Risks:

- <risk or constraint>
```

## Feedback-Driven `group` Ticket Specification

When human-managed UAT or QC feedback is not naturally a user story but needs related implementation tasks, model it as a top-level `group` ticket (or a `feature` under an existing group) and link the tasks beneath it.

```markdown
# <Feedback Group>

## Source Context

- Source system: <jira|kanban|linear|github|other>
- Source tickets: <ids or links>
- Discovered summary: <what the source material says>

## Feedback Theme

- <shared behavior, screen, defect class, or acceptance gap>

## Work Tickets

- <task title>: <implementation objective>

## Open Questions

- <question needing product, QA, or stakeholder decision>
```

## Content Guidance

- Keep product-facing docs in `group` and `feature` ticket specifications.
- List every distinct feature in the `group` ticket specification, then create a separate `feature` child ticket for each item in that list.
- A single `group` may have many `feature` children; split them by distinct actor intent, workflow, business outcome, or acceptance area.
- During story-building, stop at `group -> feature[]`.
- Keep task context in `task` ticket specifications only after implementation is requested.
- Keep approval-required implementation plans in `task` ticket `execution_plan` fields only after source exploration.
- For external source tickets, fetch/explore the source with the relevant user-provided skill first, then store `source_type`, `source_id`, `source_url`, `source_snapshot`, and relevant `source_evidence` on the Vibe Kanban work ticket. Preserve useful images and links instead of reducing the source to text only. Do not mirror source tickets as separate Vibe Kanban tickets.
- Use top-level `task` tickets when source-ticket-driven work is not naturally part of a `group/feature` hierarchy. Ask the user before linking a standalone task to an existing parent.
- During analysis, stop and ask before writing tickets when multiple intents, actors, workflows, ticket hierarchies, acceptance meanings, or product/UX/data decisions would produce different documentation. Record only minor non-behavioral assumptions directly in the ticket.
- Do not create local `documents/**`, `document.md`, product-doc `progress.md`, `.agents/processes/**/plan.md`, or `.agents/processes/**/progress.md` files as part of this skill.
- Use Vibe Kanban task ticket progress, events, commits, branch, PR, pipeline, action items, and action events for implementation trace.
- Use Vibe Kanban IDs and parent-child links as the durable navigation structure.

## Open Question Sets

Record blocking questions per audience with `pnpm vk questions <ticket-id> --category <c> --questions @file`. One file per category; the command rejects text that does not fit the category.

```markdown
<!-- requirement.md: BA / Product Owner. Observable behavior and the decision needed. No paths, identifiers, or implementation terms. -->

- When a recipient is disabled after the email is scheduled, should the preview still greet them by name?
- Is the greeting expected to change per recipient, or stay fixed to the first enabled recipient?
```

```markdown
<!-- technical.md: Tech Lead / Developers. Cite the evidence and the options. -->

- `buildGreeting()` in `src/preview/greeting.ts` greets the first enabled recipient; should disabled recipients be filtered in `RecipientRepository.listEnabled()` instead, so all previews share one rule?
- The `recipients.enabled` flag is nullable in the current migration; treat `NULL` as enabled or disabled?
```

## Use Case Writing Standard

Applies to every `group` and `feature` specification:

- Name use cases with `Verb + Noun`, such as `Create Invoice`, `Approve Order`, or `Reset Password`.
- Split use cases by distinct actor intent or system outcome. Prefer several focused use cases under one `group` over one oversized use case with unrelated flows.
- Focus on what the actor and system do, not implementation details such as service names, repositories, database tables, or framework calls.
- Write main flows as meaningful steps alternating between actor action and system response where applicable.
- Separate valid business alternatives from exceptions. Alternative flows still complete or redirect the business goal; exception flows describe failure or inability to complete.
- Keep business rules separate when they are reusable, complex, or referenced by multiple steps.
- One `group` commonly has many `feature` children. Do not collapse unrelated goals into one broad feature because they share a group.
